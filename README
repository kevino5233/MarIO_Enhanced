HOW TO TEST

Pre-reqs
Bizhawk Emulator tasvideos.org/Bizhawk.html
Super Mario World SNES ROM

1. Open the Super Mario World ROM in Bizhawk
2. Open the BizHawk Lua Console Tools->Lua Console
3. Find where you cloned this repository
	* If you want to test the control, open neatevolve_control.lua
	* Otherwise if you want to test multi modal, open neatevolve_mm.lua
4. Before running, give the test an apt name in the Lua Console SetTestname("testname")
	* I reccomend using SetTestname("control") for the control and SetTestname("mm") for the multi modal.
	* If you plan on having multiple runs, then name your runs accordingly "control1", "control2", etc.
5. It should take about 24 hours to evolve around 40 generations.
6. Once you finish that, then run the python program MarIOPlotter. Run "python MarIOPlotter.py -h" for more information on how to run them.
7. When you're done testing make sure you save your program using the pop up menu, should be the same as the testname.
