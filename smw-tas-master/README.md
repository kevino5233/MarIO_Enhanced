Emulators version
-----------------
**lsnes:**
The latest release requires lsnes-rr2-Î²23++. This is the most complete script, with more features.

**BizHawk:**
There's a script for version 1.11.0++.
The functionality is better with maximized window, necessary to display text on the black lateral gaps.

**Snes9x-rr:**
The script works in the latest versions of 1.43 and 1.51. Snes9x 1.52 has poor Lua support and 1.53 doesn't have Lua.
